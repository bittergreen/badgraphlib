# Info

This is the old version of graphlib in [Pinealand](https://github.com/bittergreen/pinealand). It's just BAD so that I 
would like to write a new one based on Google's [Pregel](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221257383_Pregel_A_system_for_large-scale_graph_processing).

However, I would like to preserve the old implementation, that's what this repo is for.
